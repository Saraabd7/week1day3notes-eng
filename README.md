# Communication
Communication is the process of transmitting information and common understanding from one person to another.

Communication Principles:


•	Clarity:  In order to make the message clear to the receivers, the message should be organised by using simple language.


•	Objective oriented: The language of communication should reflect the intention of the sender. Integration between the sender’s intention and the language used in communication certainly improves the quality of the communication.


•	Brevity: The message should be as brief as possible, compiling the message with limited words and sentences.


•	Completeness: the sender should give sufficient information so that the message is complete.

•	Consistency: the message must be consistent and pertinent to the purpose of communication. Any message conflicting to the purpose will affect negative the communication process.

•	Explanation of message: Necessary explanation of the message should be given to make it clear and easy. It helps the readers to understand the inner meaning of the message.

•	Cleanliness and correctness: the message should be written clearly and correctly. Clear handwriting, correct grammar and punctuation are essential requirements of effective written communication. In oral communication, message should also be delivered clearly.

•	Use of simple language:  uses simple, direct and appropriate languages, so for better communication ambiguous and complex words, misleading non-verbal cues, technical words and jargon, poetic words should avoided.
•	Adequate preparation: it should be taken while communicating through letter, report, memo and speech. Preparation will enhance the quality of the message.

•	Attention: pay attention to the message by both sender and receiver. This increases the accuracy of delivery by the sender and reception by the receiver.

•	Use of informal channels: communication only through normal channels may reduce its effectiveness. Hence, informal channels should be used along with the formal ones.

•	Mutual feeling: The parties involved in communication must have felling for each other. This enhances their interest and attention toward the communication message.

•	Self-confidence: The communicator should have self-confidence to the communication message. Otherwise, he will not be successful in communication.

•	Reason-ability: Communication should be based on logic and reason rather than assumption and intuition.

•	Following feedback process: Communication should have the provision of feedback. In the absence of feedback, communication will be one-way and might be incomplete.
